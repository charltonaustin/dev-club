## Producer
This represents the producer in this exercise. Here is where we should make changes first before we update the consumer.

## To set up
```shell
bundle
```
## To run server
```shell
bundle exec ruby app/important_api.rb
```
## To run rspec
In another terminal run your server before you run the specs
```
bundle exec rspec 
```
